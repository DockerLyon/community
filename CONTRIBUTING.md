## Organize an event

Below, the workflow for organizing an event:

1. Create a column on Trello.
2. Create a "Notes" card and assign it to the event organizer (maybe yourself).
The organizer referenced on this card is the person who, at least, supervises event organization.
3. Create the usual tracking cards:
     * Hoster sponsor;
     * Snack sponsor;
     * Speaker / Mentor.
4. Create other useful maps as needed.
